# python-for-fmri
Resource and tutorial series for doing fMRI analysis with Python

The use of Python in neuroscience, and specifically neuroimaging, has grown over the last several years (e.g., [Gorgolewski et al 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2011.00013/full), [Abraham et al 2014](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2014.00014/abstract), [Poldrack et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10024), [Wessel et al 2019](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30021-X)). Thanks to many open-source contributors, Python has several excellent packages for performing fMRI preprocessing and analysis, and offers [ways](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to integrate Python with existing tools and workflows out there. This Python neuroimaging ecosystem (also known as [nipy](https://nipy.org)) seems to be growing by the day, and needless to say, makes for a pretty exciting time to be a neuroimager.

So, this repository is intended for people wanting to use Python in their projects but are unsure of what it has to offer or how to get started. It is also for those who already know Python from a different context and are getting started with neuroimaging analysis in general. In any case, I hope this is helpful for those that are interested.
